Positioning a non-cooperative target via radars is useful in surveillance, information gathering and other applications to track object positions, without requiring tagging first. Often Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radars are used because of their minimal energy requirements and ability to detect obstacles such as walls. Most modern Ultra-Wide Band radars can accurately show how far away an object is, but because electromagnetic waves tend to scatter, they can not tell its direction. Thus in order to position a target correctly, we need to combine data from multiple UWB radars.

The usual way of doing this is solving for the point that satisfies all of the distance constraints. Scaling this up to position multiple targets is not easy. The student has designed a different algorithm for this that may have fewer errors while tracking multiple targets.

The purpose of the project is to implement and test the new algorithm and examine computational difficulty, ease of use, and accuracy, in order to see if the new algorithm is a plausible replacement for the old algorithm. It is more computationally difficult, but it produces more complete results, and in theory should be more accurate in most cases.
